<p>I'm a senior highschool student pursuing mastery over the Java programming language.
I currently am studying in STI, novaliches QC. I love doing challenging stuffs even though i'm still a begginer,
i hope to learn various things even outside of programming. Aside from that, i also enjoy playing games,
especially Team Fortress 2 and some variety of 2D Platformer games. I also draw whenever i'm bored.
